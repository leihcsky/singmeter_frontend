  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-4">What Is Belting (Really)?</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    In pop and musical theatre, <strong>belting</strong> usually means singing higher notes with a strong, speech-like
    intensity &mdash; the kind of sound people describe as "powerful" or "chest-y". Done well, it can be thrilling.
    Done badly, it can leave your throat feeling raw and tired.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Healthy belting is <strong>not</strong> just shouting on pitch. It combines solid breath support, efficient
    resonance, and a controlled mix of chest and head voice. In this guide, you&apos;ll learn how to belt high notes
    with power <strong>without hurting your throat</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 1: Start with Your Speaking Voice</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Belting is an extension of your <strong>speech mechanism</strong>. Try this:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Say a confident phrase like "<strong>Hey!</strong>" or "<strong>Listen!</strong>" as if you&apos;re calling a friend.</li>
    <li>Notice the natural support from your belly and the forward placement of the sound.</li>
    <li>Now put that same feeling on a simple scale on "<strong>yeah</strong>" or "<strong>hey</strong>".</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 2: Support from the Body, Not the Throat</h2>
  <div class="my-6">
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1751731/pexels-photo-1751731.jpeg?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop" alt="Breath support for safe belting" class="w-full rounded-xl shadow-md" />
  </div>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Safe belting starts with <strong>breath support</strong> and a stable body. When you belt, think:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Inhale low &mdash; feel expansion around your ribs and lower belly.</li>
    <li>Keep your chest comfortably lifted, not collapsed.</li>
    <li>Engage your core gently as you sing, like a steady &quot;push from below".</li>
    <li>Let the throat stay as relaxed as possible while the <strong>body does the work</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 3: Find Forward, Bright Resonance</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    High belting relies on efficient resonance. Instead of pushing air, you want to <strong>tune the vowel</strong> and
    direct sound into the &quot;mask&quot; area (cheeks, nose, forehead):
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Use brighter vowels like &quot;eh&quot;, &quot;ay&quot;, or &quot;ee&quot; rather than very dark &quot;ah&quot;.</li>
    <li>Imagine the sound spinning between your eyes or behind your nose.</li>
    <li>Keep your mouth open enough for resonance, but don&apos;t spread it sideways into a shout.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 4: Use a High, Stable Larynx (But Not a Shout)</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    In classical singing, we often aim for a low, stable larynx. Modern belt usually uses a slightly <strong>higher</strong>
    larynx, closer to speech. The key is control:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Let the larynx rise <strong>a bit</strong>, like when you speak loudly, but avoid extreme &quot;gag&quot; feeling.</li>
    <li>Keep the tongue relaxed and forward (think &quot;ng&quot; position) to avoid choking the sound.</li>
    <li>If you feel squeezing or scratching, back off immediately.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 5: Blend Chest and Head &mdash; Don&apos;t Drag Chest Up</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    One of the most common belting mistakes is trying to pull pure chest voice too high. Instead, you want a
    <strong>mix</strong> of chest and head resonance that still feels strong but not jammed in the throat.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Practice gliding from a comfortable chest note up into a lighter, headier sound on &quot;gee&quot; or &quot;nay&quot;. Use a
    <a href="/pitch-detector" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">pitch detector</a>
    to make sure you stay on pitch as the quality changes.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">A Simple Belting Warm-Up Routine</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Try this 10-minute sequence 3&ndash;4 times per week:
  </p>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li><strong>2 minutes &mdash; Gentle sirens:</strong> on &quot;ng&quot; or &quot;oo&quot;, slide through your range to connect registers.</li>
    <li><strong>3 minutes &mdash; &quot;Hey&quot; calls:</strong> speak-shout a mid-range &quot;hey!&quot;, then match it on a 3-note pattern.</li>
    <li><strong>3 minutes &mdash; 5-note scales:</strong> on &quot;yeah&quot;, go up and down 5-note scales, slowly moving higher.</li>
    <li><strong>2 minutes &mdash; Short song phrases:</strong> pick 1&ndash;2 phrases from a belty song and sing them gently.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Use the
    <a href="/pitch-detector" class="ml-1 text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">Pitch Detector</a>
    to make sure that as you add intensity, your <strong>pitch stays stable</strong> and doesn&apos;t go sharp or flat.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Red Flags: When to Stop</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Healthy belting should feel <strong>energetic but not painful</strong>. Stop immediately and rest if you notice:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Sharp pain or burning in the throat.</li>
    <li>Persistent hoarseness after practice.</li>
    <li>Neck and jaw muscles working harder than your breath support.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="bg-purple-50 border-l-4 border-purple-400 p-6 mt-8 rounded-r-lg">
    <p class="text-purple-700 leading-relaxed mb-2">
      <strong>Key idea:</strong> real power comes from <strong>coordination</strong>, not force. The more efficiently
      you use your breath and resonance, the less your throat has to work.
    </p>
    <p class="text-purple-700 leading-relaxed">
      Start by testing your comfortable range with the
      <a href="/vocal-range-test" class="ml-1 text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold underline">SingMeter Vocal Range Test</a>,
	      then slowly build belting skills in the upper part of that range instead of chasing extreme high notes immediately.

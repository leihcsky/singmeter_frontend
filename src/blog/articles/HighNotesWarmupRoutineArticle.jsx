  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-4">Why You Need a Specific Warm-Up for High Notes</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Trying to sing high notes on a cold voice is like sprinting without stretching. You might get away with it once
    or twice, but over time it leads to <strong>strain and fatigue</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    This 15-minute routine is designed to gently wake up your voice, connect your registers, and prepare you for
    higher singing &mdash; whether you&apos;re belting pop songs or singing classical repertoire.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Before You Start: Know Your Range</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    To warm up safely, you need to know roughly where your <strong>current top notes</strong> are. First, run the
    <a href="/vocal-range-test" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">Vocal Range Test</a>
    and note your highest comfortable note.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    In this routine, you&apos;ll mostly work in the <strong>middle and upper-middle</strong> of your range, touching the top
    area briefly rather than living there.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The 15-Minute High Notes Warm-Up</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    You can adapt the exact notes to your voice type. Use a piano app or the
    <a href="/pitch-detector" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">Pitch Detector</a>
    to stay on track.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">1. 3 Minutes &mdash; Gentle Body and Breath Activation</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Roll your shoulders, neck, and jaw to release tension.</li>
    <li>Take slow, deep breaths into your lower ribs and belly.</li>
    <li>Sigh gently on &quot;ah&quot; from mid to low notes to relax the throat.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">2. 4 Minutes &mdash; Light Sirens and Slides</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    On &quot;ng&quot; or &quot;oo&quot;, slide smoothly from low to high and back down.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Keep the volume medium or soft, focusing on smooth connection.</li>
    <li>Use the Pitch Detector to watch how your pitch moves through your range.</li>
    <li>If your voice cracks, lighten the sound rather than pushing harder.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">3. 4 Minutes &mdash; 5-Note Scales Toward the Top</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Sing 5-note scales (1&ndash;2&ndash;3&ndash;4&ndash;5&ndash;4&ndash;3&ndash;2&ndash;1) on &quot;gee&quot; or &quot;nay&quot;:
  </p>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Start in a comfortable mid-range key.</li>
    <li>Move the pattern up by semitones, stopping <strong>one or two notes below</strong> your very top.</li>
    <li>Keep the tone buzzy and forward, not heavy and shouty.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">4. 3 Minutes &mdash; Short High-Note Phrases</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Choose a simple phrase from a song that includes a higher note you want to practice.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Sing it slowly and softly at first, focusing on clean transitions.</li>
    <li>Use the Pitch Detector to confirm you&apos;re hitting the pitch, not sliding under it.</li>
    <li>Only add volume once it feels easy at a softer level.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">After the Warm-Up: How to Use It in Real Songs</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Once your voice is warm, move into your actual repertoire. Start with songs that sit mostly in your <strong>tessitura</strong>
    and only briefly touch your highest notes.
  </p>
	  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	    On days when you want to focus on technique, combine this routine with

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Tracking Progress Over Time</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    To see whether this routine is working:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Run the Vocal Range Test every few weeks to check if your top notes feel easier.</li>
    <li>Notice whether high notes in songs feel less scary and more reliable.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to how quickly your voice warms up compared to before.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-50 to-purple-50 border-l-4 border-indigo-400 p-6 mt-8 rounded-r-lg">
    <p class="text-indigo-900 leading-relaxed mb-2">
      <strong>Remember:</strong> the goal of a warm-up is not to show off your highest note, but to prepare your
      instrument so that high notes feel <strong>normal and repeatable</strong> during real singing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-indigo-900 leading-relaxed">
      Combine this routine with regular checks using the
      <a href="/vocal-range-test" class="ml-1 text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold underline">SingMeter Vocal Range Test</a>
      and the
      <a href="/pitch-detector" class="ml-1 text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold underline">Pitch Detector</a>
      to build a safer, stronger high range over time.

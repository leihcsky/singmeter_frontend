      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-4">Why Breathing and Posture Come First</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        If you were building a house, you wouldn't start with the roof. You would start with a solid foundation. In singing, 
        <strong>breathing</strong> and <strong>posture</strong> are that foundation. Before you sing a single note, your body must be aligned 
        and your breath mechanism ready. Without these two pillars, advanced techniques like belting, mixed voice, or vibrato are impossible to master safely.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Many beginners overlook these basics, rushing to hit high notes. The result? Vocal strain, weak tone, and limited range. 
        In this guide, we'll break down exactly how to stand and how to breathe to unlock your full vocal potential.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Part 1: The Perfect Singing Posture</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Your body is your instrument. Just as a bent trumpet won't play well, a slumped body won't sing well. 
        Good posture aligns your spine, opens your ribcage, and frees your larynx (voice box) to move naturally.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">The "Noble Posture" Checklist</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Stand in front of a mirror and check these five points of alignment:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li><strong>Feet:</strong> Shoulder-width apart, weight evenly distributed (not locked at the knees).</li>
        <li><strong>Hips:</strong> Neutral position. Imagine your pelvis is a bowl of water—don't spill it forward or backward.</li>
        <li><strong>Chest:</strong> Comfortably high and open, but not puffed out like a soldier.</li>
        <li><strong>Shoulders:</strong> Relaxed and down. Tension here kills vocal resonance.</li>
        <li><strong>Head:</strong> Balanced on top of your spine. Chin parallel to the floor, not reaching up or tucked down.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Quick Posture Exercise: The Rag Doll</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.<br>
        2. Slowly roll down your spine, letting your arms and head hang loose like a rag doll.<br>
        3. Shake your head "no" and "yes" gently to release neck tension.<br>
        4. Slowly roll back up, stacking one vertebra at a time.<br>
        5. When you reach the top, leave your shoulders down and your chest open. This is your singing posture.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Part 2: Diaphragmatic Breathing Explained</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        You breathe all day to survive, but <strong>singing breathing</strong> is different. It requires active control of the inhalation 
        and a slow, resisted exhalation. The key muscle here is the <strong>diaphragm</strong>.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 mb-6">
        <p class="text-blue-900 text-sm">
          <strong>What is the Diaphragm?</strong> It's a dome-shaped muscle at the bottom of your ribcage. When you inhale properly, 
          it flattens and moves down, creating space for your lungs to fill with air. This pushes your stomach and lower ribs <em>outward</em>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">How to Find Your Diaphragm</h3>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-3 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li>Lie flat on your back with a book on your belly (near your navel).</li>
        <li>Relax your shoulders and chest completely.</li>
        <li>Inhale slowly through your nose. Try to make the book rise toward the ceiling.</li>
        <li>Exhale through your mouth. Watch the book lower.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Check:</strong> Your chest and shoulders should remain still. Only the book moves.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Once you master this lying down, try it standing up. Place a hand on your belly and feel it expand as you inhale.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Breath Support: The Engine of Singing</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        "Support" is a confusing term for many. It doesn't mean pushing hard. It means <strong>managing the airflow</strong>. 
        Think of your breath like the gas pedal in a car. You want a steady, even flow of fuel, not jerky bursts.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">The Hissing Exercise (Appoggio)</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        This classic exercise builds breath control and stamina.
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-3 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li>Inhale deeply (diaphragmatic breath) for 4 counts. Feel your lower ribs expand.</li>
        <li>Exhale on a steady "Tsssss" sound (like a snake) for as long as you can.</li>
        <li>Keep the sound consistent—don't let it wobble or fade out at the end.</li>
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Aim for 30 seconds. Professional singers can often go for 60+ seconds!</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">1. The "Superman" Breath</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>The Mistake:</strong> Lifting your shoulders and puffing out your upper chest when you inhale. <br>
        <strong>Why it's bad:</strong> It creates tension in the neck and throat, limiting your range and causing vocal fatigue. <br>
        <strong>The Fix:</strong> Practice in front of a mirror. If your shoulders rise, stop and reset.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">2. Tanking Up</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>The Mistake:</strong> Trying to inhale 110% capacity. <br>
        <strong>Why it's bad:</strong> Too much air pressure creates a "breath lock," making it hard to start singing smoothly. <br>
        <strong>The Fix:</strong> Inhale comfortably, about 80-90% full. It's more about control than volume.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Your Daily 5-Minute Routine</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        You don't need hours to improve. Do this simple routine before every practice session:
      </p>
      <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-full w-6 h-6 flex items-center justify-center text-xs mr-3 mt-1 flex-shrink-0">1</span>
            <span class="text-gray-700"><strong>Posture Check (1 min):</strong> Align feet, hips, shoulders, and head. Do the Rag Doll roll-up.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-full w-6 h-6 flex items-center justify-center text-xs mr-3 mt-1 flex-shrink-0">2</span>
            <span class="text-gray-700"><strong>Deep Breaths (1 min):</strong> Place hands on lower ribs. Inhale for 4, exhale for 4. Feel the expansion.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-full w-6 h-6 flex items-center justify-center text-xs mr-3 mt-1 flex-shrink-0">3</span>
            <span class="text-gray-700"><strong>The Hiss (2 mins):</strong> Do 3-4 rounds of the "Tsssss" exercise, aiming to extend your time each round.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-full w-6 h-6 flex items-center justify-center text-xs mr-3 mt-1 flex-shrink-0">4</span>
            <span class="text-gray-700"><strong>Lip Trills (1 min):</strong> Gently buzz your lips while sliding up and down your range. This connects breath to sound.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

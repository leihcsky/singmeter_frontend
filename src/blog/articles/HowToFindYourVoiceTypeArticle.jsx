  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-4">Why Your Voice Type Matters (But Not Too Much)</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Knowing your <strong>voice type</strong> (Bass, Baritone, Tenor, Alto, Mezzo, Soprano) can help you
    choose better songs, sing more comfortably, and communicate with choir leaders or vocal coaches.
    But it should be a <strong>useful guideline</strong>, not a strict label that limits you.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    In this guide, you&apos;ll learn how to estimate your voice type <strong>by yourself at home</strong>
    using a combination of your vocal range, comfortable zone (tessitura), and tone color.
    We will also show you how to use SingMeter&apos;s tools to make this process easier.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 1: Measure Your Vocal Range</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    First, you need to know the <strong>lowest</strong> and <strong>highest</strong> notes you can
    sing clearly. The easiest way is to use an online range tool.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>
      Go to the <a href="/vocal-range-test" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">Vocal Range Test</a>
      on SingMeter.
    </li>
    <li>Follow the instructions to record your lowest comfortable note and highest comfortable note.</li>
    <li>Write down the result, for example: <strong>G2–E4</strong> or <strong>A3–C6</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Don&apos;t worry if the numbers don&apos;t look &quot;impressive&quot; — what matters is that they are
    <strong>comfortable and healthy</strong>, not forced.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 2: Find Your Tessitura (Comfort Zone)</h2>
  <div class="my-6">
    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520523839897-bd0b52f945a0?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop" alt="Vocal range chart showing tessitura" class="w-full rounded-xl shadow-md" />
  </div>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Your <strong>tessitura</strong> is the part of your range where your voice feels easiest and sounds
    the best. This is often <strong>more important</strong> than your extreme highest or lowest notes.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Pick 3–5 simple songs you know well.</li>
    <li>Notice where your voice feels relaxed and natural most of the time.</li>
    <li>
      Use SingMeter&apos;s <a href="/pitch-detector" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">Pitch Detector</a>
      to see which notes appear again and again in those &quot;easy&quot; parts.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    If most of your comfortable notes sit lower in your total range, you&apos;re likely a lower voice type.
    If they sit higher, you&apos;re likely a higher voice type.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 3: Compare with Typical Voice Type Ranges</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Now, compare your range + tessitura with typical ranges for common voice types
    (these are <strong>approximate</strong> and can vary by singer):
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li><strong>Bass:</strong> roughly E2–E4, comfortable around G2–C4</li>
    <li><strong>Baritone:</strong> roughly A2–A4, comfortable around C3–E4</li>
    <li><strong>Tenor:</strong> roughly C3–C5, comfortable around E3–G4</li>
    <li><strong>Alto (Contralto):</strong> roughly F3–F5, comfortable around A3–D5</li>
    <li><strong>Mezzo-Soprano:</strong> roughly A3–A5, comfortable around C4–E5</li>
    <li><strong>Soprano:</strong> roughly C4–C6, comfortable around E4–G5</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Ask yourself: <strong>Where does my comfortable zone overlap the most?</strong> That is usually
    your best &quot;home base&quot; voice type.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 4: Listen to Your Tone and Weight</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Range is only part of the story. Voice type also relates to the <strong>color</strong> and
    <strong>weight</strong> of your sound.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Lighter, brighter voices often lean toward Tenor or Soprano.</li>
    <li>Darker, heavier voices often lean toward Baritone, Bass, Alto, or Contralto.</li>
    <li>Many singers feel &quot;in between&quot; (for example, between Alto and Mezzo-Soprano).</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Record yourself singing a simple scale or song, then listen back.
    Focus on <strong>how</strong> your voice sounds, not just how high or low it can go.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 5: Put It All Together</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Combine these three elements:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Your measured vocal range (from the Vocal Range Test)</li>
    <li>Your comfortable tessitura from real songs</li>
    <li>The tone and weight of your voice</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    From there, you can say something like: &quot;I&apos;m probably a light lyric Tenor&quot; or
    &quot;I&apos;m somewhere between Alto and Mezzo-Soprano.&quot; That&apos;s good enough for
    <strong>choir placement, song choice, and basic training</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Common Mistakes When Finding Your Voice Type</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li><strong>Only looking at extreme notes:</strong> your highest note is less important than your tessitura.</li>
    <li><strong>Forcing high notes:</strong> if it feels strained, don&apos;t count it as part of your real range.</li>
    <li><strong>Comparing to others:</strong> your voice grows at its own pace — focus on healthy singing.</li>
    <li><strong>Thinking it&apos;s permanent:</strong> your range and comfort zone can shift with training and age.</li>
  </ul>

    <p class="text-indigo-700 leading-relaxed mb-2">
      <strong>Remember:</strong> your voice type is a <strong>tool</strong>, not a prison.
      Use it to choose better songs and exercises, but don&apos;t let it limit your musical
      curiosity.

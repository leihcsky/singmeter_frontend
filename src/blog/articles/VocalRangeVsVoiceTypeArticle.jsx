  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-4">Range and Voice Type Are Not the Same Thing</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    It&apos;s very common to see questions like: &quot;My range is G2–C5, what is my voice type?&quot;
    The truth is: <strong>your vocal range alone cannot fully decide your voice type</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    In this article, we&apos;ll break down the difference between <strong>vocal range</strong> and
    <strong>voice type</strong>, and help you understand what really matters for your singing
    progress.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What Is Vocal Range?</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Your <strong>vocal range</strong> is the distance between the lowest and highest notes you
    can sing clearly and safely. For example, from <strong>C3 to C5</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Range can change with training, age, and vocal health.</li>
    <li>Most people can <strong>expand</strong> their range a bit over time.</li>
    <li>Good technique often reveals notes you already had, but didn&apos;t control yet.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    You can measure your range quickly with the
    <a href="/vocal-range-test" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">SingMeter Vocal Range Test</a>
    and see your lowest and highest comfortable pitches.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What Is Voice Type?</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Your <strong>voice type</strong> is a broader classification that includes:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Your total range.</li>
    <li>Your <strong>tessitura</strong> (where your voice is comfortable most of the time).</li>
    <li>Your tone color (bright, dark, light, heavy, etc.).</li>
    <li>Where your register transitions (chest/head mix) tend to happen.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    In classical music, teachers sometimes use a detailed system called <strong>Fach</strong>
    to classify voices, but for most modern singers a simple category like Tenor, Baritone,
    Alto, or Soprano is enough.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What Can Change and What Stays Similar</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    With training, several things about your voice can change:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>You can <strong>expand</strong> your usable range up or down.</li>
    <li>You can make high notes feel easier and more reliable.</li>
    <li>You can change how you <strong>use</strong> your voice (style, resonance, mix, etc.).</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    But some things tend to stay more stable over time:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Your basic <strong>vocal weight</strong> (light vs heavy) and tone color.</li>
    <li>The general <strong>zone</strong> where your voice likes to live.</li>
    <li>Whether you naturally lean lower or higher compared to other singers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Obsessing Over Labels Can Slow You Down</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Many beginners spend a lot of time trying to figure out if they are a Tenor or a Baritone,
    a Mezzo or a Soprano. In reality, your <strong>practice routine</strong> matters much more
    than the exact label.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>You don&apos;t need a perfect label to start training effectively.</li>
    <li>Good technique is similar across neighboring voice types.</li>
    <li>Trying to &quot;force&quot; yourself into a higher type can lead to strain.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How to Use Range and Voice Type in a Healthy Way</h2>
  <ul class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>
      Start by <strong>measuring your range</strong> with the
      <a href="/vocal-range-test" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">Vocal Range Test</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Notice where your voice feels comfortable during songs (that&apos;s your tessitura).</li>
    <li>Use simple labels like &quot;lower male&quot;, &quot;middle female&quot;, &quot;higher male&quot; at first.</li>
    <li>Choose songs that sit mostly in your comfortable middle area.</li>
    <li>If you work with a teacher later, let them refine your classification.</li>
  </ul>

      <strong>Key idea:</strong> treat &quot;vocal range&quot; and &quot;voice type&quot; as
      <strong>useful tools</strong>, not strict rules.
    </p>
    <p class="text-indigo-700 leading-relaxed">
      First, get clear data from the
      <a href="/vocal-range-test" class="ml-1 text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold underline">SingMeter Vocal Range Test</a>,
      then use that information to pick better songs and exercises, instead of chasing a
      specific label.

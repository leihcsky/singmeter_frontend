      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-4">Why Vocal Health Matters</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Imagine a guitarist smashing their guitar after every show. It sounds ridiculous, right? Yet many singers abuse their instrument—their vocal cords—daily without realizing it. 
        Unlike a guitar strings, you can't just buy a new set of vocal cords. 
        <strong>Vocal health</strong> is the practice of maintaining your voice to prevent injury, nodules, and chronic hoarseness.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Golden Rule: Hydration</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Your vocal cords are coated in a mucous membrane that needs to stay moist to vibrate efficiently. 
        When you are dehydrated, this mucus becomes thick and sticky, causing friction and irritation.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 mb-6">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-blue-900 mb-2">Hydration Tips:</h4>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-blue-800 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Drink Water:</strong> Aim for 8-10 glasses a day. Room temperature is best.</li>
          <li><strong>Timing Matters:</strong> Water takes about 2 hours to reach your vocal cords. Drinking <em>during</em> a show helps a little, but drinking <em>before</em> helps a lot.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid Drying Agents:</strong> Caffeine and alcohol are diuretics (they dehydrate you). Balance them with extra water.</li>
          <li><strong>Steaming:</strong> Inhaling steam directly hydrates the vocal tract. Use a personal steamer or a bowl of hot water with a towel over your head.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Vocal Dos and Don'ts</h2>
      
      <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
        <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-green-200">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-green-900 mb-3">✅ DO:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-green-800">
            <li>✓ <strong>Warm up</strong> before singing (even for 5-10 mins).</li>
            <li>✓ <strong>Cool down</strong> after a long session with gentle humming.</li>
            <li>✓ <strong>Rest your voice</strong> (vocal nap) if you've been talking/singing all day.</li>
            <li>✓ <strong>Sleep well.</strong> Your voice repairs itself while you sleep.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-red-200">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-900 mb-3">❌ DON'T:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-red-800">
            <li>✗ <strong>Clear your throat.</strong> It slams your vocal cords together violently. Swallow or sip water instead.</li>
            <li>✗ <strong>Whisper.</strong> Surprisingly, whispering forces the vocal cords tight and causes more strain than speaking softly.</li>
            <li>✗ <strong>Shout or scream</strong> in loud environments (concerts, bars).</li>
            <li>✗ <strong>Sing through pain.</strong> Pain is a stop sign.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Warning Signs: When to Stop</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Your body will tell you when something is wrong. Watch out for these red flags:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li><strong>Hoarseness:</strong> A raspy or breathy tone that lasts more than 2 weeks requires a doctor (ENT) visit.</li>
        <li><strong>Loss of High Notes:</strong> Often the first sign of swelling (edema).</li>
        <li><strong>Tickling or Pain:</strong> If it hurts to sing or swallow, stop immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Vocal Fatigue:</strong> If your voice gets tired after only 10 minutes of singing, your technique may be forcing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Foods and Reflux (GERD)</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Acid reflux (heartburn) is a singer's enemy. Stomach acid can rise up while you sleep and burn your vocal cords.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">How to Manage Reflux:</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li>Avoid eating late at night (2-3 hours before bed).</li>
        <li>Limit spicy, acidic, or fried foods.</li>
        <li>Elevate the head of your bed slightly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The "Vocal Nap"</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Just as athletes take rest days, singers need vocal rest. A "vocal nap" is a period of absolute silence—no talking, no humming, no whispering.
        Try taking a 20-minute vocal nap before a show or after a long rehearsal. It works wonders for resetting your voice.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Vocal health isn't just about avoiding damage; it's about longevity. If you want to be singing happily in 10, 20, or 30 years, start taking care of your instrument today.
        Stay hydrated, warm up properly, and listen to your body!

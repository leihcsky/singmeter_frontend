      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-4">You Can Practice Pitch Without a Piano</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Many singers think they cannot train their pitch unless they have a piano or full karaoke backing tracks. In reality,
        you can build strong pitch control with just your voice, your phone, and a few simple tools. This article shows you how
        to practice singing in tune <strong>anywhere</strong>, even if you do not play an instrument.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Tool 1: Use a Pitch Detector as Your "Digital Piano"</h2>
      <div class="my-6">
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493225457124-a3eb161ffa5f?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop" alt="Pitch detector used as digital piano replacement" class="w-full rounded-xl shadow-md" />
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        A pitch detector turns your browser into a real-time tuner for your voice. Instead of playing notes on a piano, you sing
        and watch the screen to see whether you are on pitch, sharp, or flat.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Open the
        <a href="/pitch-detector" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">SingMeter Pitch Detector</a>
        in a tab. When you sing, it shows the note name, frequency, and how many cents you are away from the target. Treat this
        as your main reference tool during practice.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Tool 2: Use Simple Reference Notes from Apps</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Even without a piano, you can still get clean reference pitches from apps:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li>Free keyboard or tuner apps that play single notes.</li>
        <li>YouTube videos that play scales or drone notes.</li>
        <li>Metronome or tone generator apps with a “pitch” function.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Use these sounds to set your starting note, then switch to the pitch detector to monitor your voice as you continue.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Exercise 1: Single-Note Home Practice</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        This exercise teaches you to land accurately on one note without any instrument in your hands.
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li>Play one note on a phone app, then pause the sound.</li>
        <li>Try to hear the note in your head for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Sing the note and watch the pitch detector to see where you land.</li>
        <li>Adjust up or down until you are close to 0 cents.</li>
        <li>Repeat this with different starting notes in your comfortable range.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Exercise 2: “Step Up, Step Down” Scales</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Scales are still one of the best ways to practice singing in tune, and you do not need an instrument to use them.
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li>Choose a comfortable starting note using a reference app or the
          <a href="/vocal-range-test" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">vocal range test</a>.</li>
        <li>Sing a 5-note scale up and down (for example, do–re–mi–fa–so–fa–mi–re–do).</li>
        <li>Watch the pitch detector for each step — do some notes always go sharp or flat?</li>
        <li>Slow down problem spots and repeat them until they stabilize.</li>
        <li>Gradually explore higher and lower scales as your control improves.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Exercise 3: Acapella Song Fragments</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Singing an entire song acapella can be overwhelming. Instead, break it into short fragments that you can tune carefully.
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li>Pick one or two lines from a song you like.</li>
        <li>Find the starting note with a phone app or backing track, then stop the audio.</li>
        <li>Sing the fragment slowly on a vowel while watching the pitch detector.</li>
        <li>Notice where your pitch drifts and practice just those words or notes.</li>
        <li>Add the lyrics and rhythm back in once you can sing the fragment in tune.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Exercise 4: Record and Review Yourself</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Your phone microphone is one of the most powerful practice tools you own. Recording yourself reveals pitch issues you may
        not notice while you are singing.
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li>Record a short practice session: scales, exercises, or a verse of a song.</li>
        <li>Listen back with the pitch detector open and watch the display as your recording plays.</li>
        <li>Mark sections where you consistently go off pitch.</li>
        <li>Practice those sections again live with the detector, aiming to correct the problem.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Create a No-Equipment Practice Routine</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Here is an example 15-minute routine you can do at home without a piano or backing track:
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li><strong>3 minutes:</strong> gentle warm-up (humming, lip trills).</li>
        <li><strong>4 minutes:</strong> single-note matching with a phone app and the pitch detector.</li>
        <li><strong>4 minutes:</strong> step-up/step-down scales across your comfortable range.</li>
        <li><strong>4 minutes:</strong> acapella fragments from one song, recorded and reviewed.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        You can do this quietly in a bedroom or practice room, using only your phone and a browser. Over time, you will feel your
        pitch lock in more quickly, even when you later sing with full backing tracks or live musicians.

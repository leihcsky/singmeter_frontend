  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-4">Tessitura: More Important Than Your Highest Note</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Many singers obsess over how high or low they can sing. But for real-world singing, what matters most is your
    <strong>tessitura</strong>: the part of your range where your voice feels comfortable and sounds the best.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    In this guide, you&apos;ll learn what tessitura is, how to find your own comfortable range, and how to use that
    knowledge to <strong>choose better songs and keys</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What Is Tessitura?</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Tessitura is the range of notes where you can sing for a long time without fatigue, with a <strong>consistent,
    beautiful tone</strong>. It&apos;s usually a narrower band inside your full vocal range.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Your full range might be, for example, <strong>A2–E4</strong>.</li>
    <li>Your tessitura might be more like <strong>C3–C4</strong>, where everything feels easy and natural.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 1: Measure Your Full Range</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    First, get a clear idea of your overall range using a simple online tool.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>
      Take the
      <a href="/vocal-range-test" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">SingMeter Vocal Range Test</a>
      and write down your lowest and highest comfortable notes.
    </li>
    <li>Don&apos;t count notes that feel strained, shouted, or unstable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 2: Find Your Real Comfort Zone</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Next, pay attention to where your voice feels the most <strong>relaxed and dependable</strong> in real songs.
  </p>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Pick 3–5 simple songs you know very well.</li>
    <li>Sing them while using the
      <a href="/pitch-detector" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">Pitch Detector</a>
      to see which notes you hit most often.
    </li>
    <li>Notice which notes feel effortless and which ones feel like &quot;stretching&quot;.</li>
    <li>Write down the rough range of those easy, everyday notes.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 3: Compare Tessitura with Voice Type Charts</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Once you know your comfort zone, compare it with a
    <a href="/blog/vocal-range-chart" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">basic vocal range chart</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    For example, if your tessitura is mostly around C3–E4, you may sit in the Baritone area, even if you can
    occasionally touch higher notes.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How Tessitura Helps You Choose the Right Key</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    When a song feels &quot;too high&quot; or &quot;too low&quot;, it usually means the song&apos;s tessitura doesn&apos;t match yours.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>If most of the melody sits above your comfort zone, you&apos;ll get tired and tense quickly.</li>
    <li>If it sits too low, your voice may sound dull and unsupported.</li>
    <li>The ideal key keeps <strong>80–90%</strong> of the song inside your comfortable middle area.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Practical Tips for Singing in Your Best Range</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>When learning a new song, test it in different keys until your voice feels relaxed.</li>
    <li>Don&apos;t be afraid to <strong>transpose</strong> karaoke tracks or sheet music.</li>
    <li>For long gigs or sets, prioritize songs that sit mostly in your tessitura.</li>
    <li>Use high or low &quot;show-off&quot; notes as accents, not the main event.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Tessitura and Vocal Health</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Singing outside your tessitura once in a while is fine. But spending <strong>most of your time</strong>
    too high or too low can lead to:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Vocal fatigue and loss of stamina.</li>
    <li>Tension in your throat, jaw, and neck.</li>
    <li>Bad habits like pushing, squeezing, or shouting.</li>
  </ul>

    <p class="text-indigo-700 leading-relaxed mb-2">
      <strong>Key idea:</strong> your tessitura is where your voice &quot;lives&quot; most comfortably.
      Building your repertoire and practice routine around it will make you sound better and feel better.

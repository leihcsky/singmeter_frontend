  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-4">What Is a Vocal Range Chart?</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    A <strong>vocal range chart</strong> shows the typical lowest and highest notes for different voice types.
    It&apos;s a visual way to understand where <strong>Bass, Baritone, Tenor, Alto, Mezzo-Soprano, and Soprano</strong>
    usually sit on the keyboard.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    In this article, you&apos;ll see a simple chart for male and female voices, and learn how to
    <strong>use it together with your own vocal range test results</strong> from SingMeter.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Vocal Range Chart (Approximate)</h2>
  <div class="my-6">
    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511379938547-c1f69419868d?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop" alt="Detailed vocal range chart with voice type ranges" class="w-full rounded-xl shadow-md" />
  </div>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    These ranges are <strong>typical examples</strong> for trained singers. Real voices can be
    slightly lower or higher, and there is natural overlap between categories.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Male Voice Types</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li><strong>Bass:</strong> E2 – E4 (very low male voice)</li>
    <li><strong>Baritone:</strong> A2 – A4 (most common male voice)</li>
    <li><strong>Tenor:</strong> C3 – C5 (higher male voice)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Female Voice Types</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li><strong>Alto / Contralto:</strong> F3 – F5 (lower female voice)</li>
    <li><strong>Mezzo-Soprano:</strong> A3 – A5 (middle female voice)</li>
    <li><strong>Soprano:</strong> C4 – C6 (higher female voice)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="bg-indigo-50 border-l-4 border-indigo-400 p-5 mt-6 rounded-r-lg">
    <p class="text-indigo-700 leading-relaxed">
      These are <strong>guidelines, not rules</strong>. It&apos;s normal if your range doesn&apos;t
      fit perfectly into one box. Many singers sit between two categories.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How to Use This Chart with Your Own Range</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    The best way to use a vocal range chart is together with an accurate test of your own range.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>
      Take the <a href="/vocal-range-test" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">Vocal Range Test</a>
      on SingMeter and note your lowest and highest comfortable notes.
    </li>
    <li>Find those notes on the chart above and see which voice type they overlap with the most.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to where your <strong>comfortable middle area</strong> (tessitura) sits, not only the extremes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    For example, if your range is roughly <strong>G2–E4</strong> and most of your comfortable notes are around
    C3–C4, you probably sit in the <strong>Baritone</strong> area, even if you can sometimes hit a higher note.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Range vs. Tessitura</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Two singers can have the <strong>same total range</strong> but different tessituras:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>One feels comfortable mostly in the lower half of that range.</li>
    <li>The other feels comfortable mostly in the upper half.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    They might be classified differently, even though their extreme high and low notes are similar.
    This is why the chart is a <strong>starting point</strong>, not a full diagnosis.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Typical Uses of a Vocal Range Chart</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li><strong>Choirs:</strong> placing singers into Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Bass sections.</li>
    <li><strong>Song choice:</strong> checking if a song&apos;s melody fits your range.</li>
    <li><strong>Training goals:</strong> setting realistic targets for range expansion.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-knowledge:</strong> understanding where your voice naturally lives.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Limitations of Any Vocal Range Chart</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    No chart can fully describe your voice. It does <strong>not</strong> show:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
    <li>Your tone color (bright vs dark).</li>
    <li>Your vocal weight (light vs heavy).</li>
    <li>Your ability to sing softly or loudly at different pitches.</li>
    <li>How your voice behaves over time as you train.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Think of the chart as a <strong>map</strong>. Useful, but not the same as actually walking the
    landscape with your own voice.
  </p>

  <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-50 to-purple-50 border-l-4 border-indigo-400 p-6 mt-8 rounded-r-lg">
    <p class="text-indigo-900 leading-relaxed mb-2">
      The most valuable thing you can do is <strong>combine</strong> this chart with real data from your
      own singing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-indigo-900 leading-relaxed">
      Start by running the
      <a href="/vocal-range-test" class="ml-1 text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800 font-semibold underline">SingMeter Vocal Range Test</a>,
      then come back to this chart to see where you fit. Use it as a guide when choosing songs
      and planning your vocal training.

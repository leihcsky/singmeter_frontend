      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-4">Why Practice with a Pitch Detector?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        A <strong>pitch detector</strong> is more than just a fun visualization of your voice. Used correctly, it can act like a
        mini vocal coach that listens to every note you sing and gives instant feedback. Instead of guessing whether you are in
        tune, you can <strong>see</strong> it on the screen.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        In this guide we will use the
        <a href="/pitch-detector" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">SingMeter Pitch Detector</a>
        as an example, but the principles apply to any real-time tuner. You will learn how to use it for warm-ups, scales,
        problem notes, and real songs.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Understanding What the Detector Shows You</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        When you open the SingMeter Pitch Detector, you will see three main pieces of information:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li><strong>Note name:</strong> for example A3, C4, F#4 — the musical note you are closest to.</li>
        <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> the pitch in Hertz (Hz), such as 440 Hz for A4.</li>
        <li><strong>Cents deviation:</strong> how far you are from the exact center of the note. 0 cents means perfectly in tune.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Most singers aim to stay within about <strong>±10 cents</strong> for everyday singing, and within <strong>±5 cents</strong>
        for very accurate work such as studio recording.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 1: Warm Up with Gentle Monitoring</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Start your practice by using the pitch detector as a soft guide, not a strict judge.
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li>Turn on the detector and begin with light humming and lip trills.</li>
        <li>Notice how the display moves when you slide up and down in pitch.</li>
        <li>Do not worry about being perfectly in tune yet — you are just waking up your voice and ears.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 2: Single-Note Accuracy Training</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Now use the detector in a more focused way to improve how accurately you can hold individual notes.
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li>Pick 4–6 notes across your comfortable range (you can find this with the
          <a href="/vocal-range-test" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700 font-semibold underline">vocal range test</a>).</li>
        <li>On each note, sing a long tone for 5–10 seconds while watching the cents indicator.</li>
        <li>Adjust your support, vowel shape, and resonance to keep the value as close to 0 as possible.</li>
        <li>Repeat each note a few times and notice which ones are harder to keep steady.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 3: Scale and Interval Practice</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Scales and intervals are where the detector becomes a precision training tool.
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li>Sing simple scales (major, minor, or pentatonic) slowly.</li>
        <li>Watch how your pitch changes on each step — are some notes consistently sharp or flat?</li>
        <li>Isolate problem notes and practice “landing” on them from above and below.</li>
        <li>Practice common intervals (thirds, fourths, fifths, octaves) and use the display to confirm you are hitting them cleanly.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 4: Fixing Specific Pitch Problems</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Most singers have recurring pitch patterns, such as always going flat on low notes or sharp on powerful high notes. The
        detector helps you spot and fix these patterns.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li><strong>Flat low notes:</strong> practice short, energized patterns on low notes and keep the display from drifting below 0.</li>
        <li><strong>Sharp high notes:</strong> sing high notes more gently and see how little effort you actually need to stay centered.</li>
        <li><strong>Wobbly sustained notes:</strong> practice long tones while trying to keep the cents value as still as possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 5: Applying the Detector to Real Songs</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        The most valuable way to use a pitch detector is on the music you love. Here is a simple process for applying it to songs:
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li>Pick one short section of a song (one verse or chorus).</li>
        <li>Sing it slowly without accompaniment while the detector is running.</li>
        <li>Notice which words or syllables pull the pitch off center.</li>
        <li>Turn that tiny section into its own exercise: loop it and correct it until the pitch looks stable.</li>
        <li>Rebuild the full phrase, keeping the same body feeling that gave you accurate pitch.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 6: When Not to Look at the Screen</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        A pitch detector is a training aid, not a permanent crutch. There are times when you should deliberately <strong>not</strong>
        watch the display.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li>Turn it off for full emotional run-throughs of songs.</li>
        <li>Practice short sections by ear first, then turn the detector on afterward to check how you did.</li>
        <li>Focus on memorizing the <strong>feeling</strong> of good pitch (resonance, ease, breath) instead of chasing numbers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">A 15-Minute Pitch Detector Training Routine</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Here is a sample daily practice plan using the SingMeter Pitch Detector:
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
        <li><strong>3 minutes:</strong> gentle warm-up while casually watching how the display responds to your voice.</li>
        <li><strong>4 minutes:</strong> single-note long tones across your comfortable range.</li>
        <li><strong>4 minutes:</strong> slow scales and key intervals, focusing on your weakest notes.</li>
        <li><strong>4 minutes:</strong> one song section in “training mode” (slow, with detector) followed by one in “performance mode” (normal speed, no screen).</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Used this way, the pitch detector becomes a powerful but simple coach that helps you build precision without losing the
        joy of singing.

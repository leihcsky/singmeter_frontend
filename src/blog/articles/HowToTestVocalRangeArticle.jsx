	      </div>

	      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-4">Understanding Vocal Range</h2>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        Your <strong>vocal range</strong> is the span between the lowest and highest notes you can comfortably sing. 
	        It's one of the most important characteristics of your voice and helps determine your voice type classification 
	        (Bass, Baritone, Tenor, Alto, Mezzo-Soprano, or Soprano).
	      </p>

	      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Test Your Vocal Range?</h2>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        Testing your vocal range provides several benefits:
	      </p>
	      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
	        <li><strong>Song Selection:</strong> Choose songs that fit your natural range</li>
	        <li><strong>Voice Classification:</strong> Identify your voice type for choir or ensemble work</li>
	        <li><strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> Monitor improvements in your vocal training</li>
	        <li><strong>Vocal Health:</strong> Avoid straining by staying within your comfortable range</li>
	        <li><strong>Professional Development:</strong> Essential information for auditions and performances</li>
	      </ul>

	      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Methods to Test Your Vocal Range</h2>
	      
	      <div class="my-6">
	        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493225457124-a3eb161ffa5f?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop" alt="Person using online vocal range test tool on computer" class="w-full rounded-xl shadow-md" />
	      </div>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">1. Online Vocal Range Test (Recommended)</h3>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        Modern online tools like SingMeter use advanced pitch detection technology to accurately measure your vocal range. 
	        This method is quick, accurate, and provides instant results. Simply sing into your device's microphone, and the 
	        software analyzes your pitch in real-time.
	      </p>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">2. Piano or Keyboard Method</h3>
	      <div class="my-6">
	        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520523839897-bd0b52f945a0?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop" alt="Piano keyboard for vocal range testing" class="w-full rounded-xl shadow-md" />
	      </div>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        If you have access to a piano or keyboard, you can manually test your range by matching pitches. Start at middle C 
	        and sing along with each note, moving up and down the keyboard until you reach your comfortable limits. Record the 
	        lowest and highest notes you can sing clearly.
	      </p>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">3. Professional Voice Assessment</h3>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        A vocal coach or voice teacher can provide the most comprehensive assessment. They'll not only measure your range 
	        but also evaluate your vocal quality, technique, and potential for development.
	      </p>

	      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Tips for Accurate Testing</h2>
	      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
	        <li><strong>Warm Up First:</strong> Do gentle vocal exercises before testing</li>
	        <li><strong>Quiet Environment:</strong> Test in a quiet room for best results</li>
	        <li><strong>Comfortable Volume:</strong> Sing at a moderate, comfortable volume</li>
	        <li><strong>Don't Force It:</strong> Stop if you feel strain or discomfort</li>
	        <li><strong>Test Multiple Times:</strong> Your range can vary by time of day and vocal condition</li>
	        <li><strong>Use Quality Equipment:</strong> A good microphone improves accuracy for online tests</li>
	      </ul>

	      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Your Results</h2>
	      <div class="my-6">

	      </div>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        Once you know your range, you can identify your voice type:
	      </p>
	      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
	        <li><strong>Bass:</strong> E2 to E4 (lowest male voice)</li>
	        <li><strong>Baritone:</strong> A2 to A4 (middle male voice)</li>
	        <li><strong>Tenor:</strong> C3 to C5 (highest male voice)</li>
	        <li><strong>Alto:</strong> F3 to F5 (lowest female voice)</li>
	        <li><strong>Mezzo-Soprano:</strong> A3 to A5 (middle female voice)</li>
	        <li><strong>Soprano:</strong> C4 to C6 (highest female voice)</li>
	      </ul>

	      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step-by-Step Guide: Using an Online Vocal Range Test</h2>
	      <div class="my-6">
	        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511379938547-c1f69419868d?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop" alt="Step by step vocal range testing process" class="w-full rounded-xl shadow-md" />
	      </div>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        Online vocal range tests have revolutionized how singers discover their range. Here's a detailed walkthrough of how to use them effectively:
	      </p>
	      
	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Preparation (5 minutes)</h3>
	      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
	        <li><strong>Find a quiet space:</strong> Background noise can interfere with accurate pitch detection. Choose a room with minimal echo and ambient sound.</li>
	        <li><strong>Check your microphone:</strong> Ensure your device's microphone is working and not muted. Test it by speaking or humming before starting.</li>
	        <li><strong>Warm up gently:</strong> Do 2-3 minutes of light vocal warm-ups (humming, lip trills) to prepare your voice. Don't overdo it—you want to test your natural range, not your warmed-up range.</li>
	        <li><strong>Have water nearby:</strong> Stay hydrated, but don't drink immediately before testing as it can affect your vocal cords.</li>
	      </ol>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Testing Your Lowest Note</h3>
	      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
	        <li>Start from a comfortable mid-range note (around middle C or C4).</li>
	        <li>Gradually descend the scale, singing each note clearly on a vowel sound like "ah" or "oh".</li>
	        <li>Continue descending until you reach a note that feels uncomfortable or strained.</li>
	        <li>Go back up one note—this is likely your lowest comfortable note.</li>
	        <li>Record this note clearly, holding it for 2-3 seconds so the software can detect it accurately.</li>
	      </ol>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        <strong>Important:</strong> Your lowest note should be one you can sing with good tone quality, not just a growl or whisper. If you can only produce a sound by forcing or straining, that's not part of your usable range.
	      </p>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Testing Your Highest Note</h3>
	      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
	        <li>Return to your comfortable mid-range starting point.</li>
	        <li>Gradually ascend the scale, maintaining good breath support.</li>
	        <li>Continue ascending until you feel tension or your voice wants to "flip" into falsetto or head voice.</li>
	        <li>Go back down one note—this is likely your highest comfortable note in your primary register.</li>
	        <li>Record this note clearly, holding it for 2-3 seconds.</li>
	      </ol>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        <strong>Note about registers:</strong> Some tests ask you to test both your chest voice (full voice) and head voice/falsetto ranges separately. This gives you a complete picture of your vocal capabilities.
	      </p>

	      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Interpreting Your Results</h2>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        Once you have your range results, here's how to understand and use them:
	      </p>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Understanding the Notation</h3>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        Vocal ranges are typically written in scientific pitch notation, where:
	      </p>
	      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
	        <li>The letter (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) indicates the note name</li>
	        <li>The number indicates the octave (C4 = middle C, C5 = one octave above middle C)</li>
	        <li>Sharps (#) or flats (b) indicate accidentals</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        For example, a range of <strong>G2 to E4</strong> means your lowest note is G in the second octave, and your highest note is E in the fourth octave.
	      </p>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">What Your Range Tells You</h3>
	      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
	        <li><strong>Song Selection:</strong> Songs that sit primarily within your range will be more comfortable to sing</li>
	        <li><strong>Key Transposition:</strong> If a song is too high or low, you can transpose it to fit your range</li>
	        <li><strong>Voice Type Identification:</strong> Your range helps determine your voice classification</li>
	        <li><strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> Regular testing shows if your range is expanding with training</li>
	        <li><strong>Vocal Health:</strong> Sudden changes in your range can indicate vocal health issues</li>
	      </ul>

	      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Common Questions About Vocal Range Testing</h2>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Q: How often should I test my vocal range?</h3>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        <strong>A:</strong> For beginners, testing every 2-3 months is sufficient to track progress. More experienced singers might test monthly or when they notice changes. Don't test too frequently (daily or weekly) as your range can vary slightly based on time of day, vocal condition, and other factors. Testing too often can lead to frustration or overthinking.
	      </p>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Q: My range seems small. Is that normal?</h3>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        <strong>A:</strong> Yes! Most untrained singers have a range of about 1.5-2 octaves. With proper training, this typically expands to 2-3 octaves. The quality of your voice within your range is more important than the size of your range. Many professional singers have relatively modest ranges but use them exceptionally well.
	      </p>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Q: Can my vocal range change over time?</h3>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        <strong>A:</strong> Absolutely! Your range can expand with training, change with age, and vary based on vocal health. Many singers find their range increases by several semitones with consistent practice. However, natural aging can also affect range, particularly in the upper register. Regular vocal training helps maintain and extend your range throughout your singing career.
	      </p>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Q: Should I include falsetto/head voice in my range?</h3>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        <strong>A:</strong> This depends on your goals. For classical voice classification, typically only your primary register (chest voice for most) is considered. However, for contemporary singing, many singers include their head voice and even falsetto range, as these are used regularly in performance. Some tests provide separate measurements for different registers, which gives you the most complete picture.
	      </p>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Q: What if I get different results each time I test?</h3>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        <strong>A:</strong> Small variations (1-2 semitones) are completely normal. Your range can vary based on:
	      </p>
	      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
	        <li>Time of day (voices are often more flexible in the afternoon/evening)</li>
	        <li>Vocal warm-up level</li>
	        <li>Fatigue or vocal condition</li>
	        <li>Environmental factors (humidity, temperature)</li>
	        <li>Emotional state or stress levels</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        If you notice consistent, significant variations, consider testing at the same time of day and after the same warm-up routine for more consistent results.
	      </p>

	      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Using Your Range Results for Song Selection</h2>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        Once you know your range, you can make smarter song choices:
	      </p>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Finding Songs in Your Range</h3>
	      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
	        <li><strong>Use range databases:</strong> Many websites list songs with their vocal ranges</li>
	        <li><strong>Test songs yourself:</strong> Sing along and note which notes feel comfortable</li>
	        <li><strong>Transpose when needed:</strong> Don't be afraid to change the key of a song to fit your voice</li>
	        <li><strong>Consider tessitura:</strong> A song might technically be in your range, but if it sits at the extremes, it may still be uncomfortable</li>
	      </ul>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Understanding Tessitura vs. Range</h3>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        <strong>Tessitura</strong> refers to where most of the notes in a song lie, while <strong>range</strong> refers to the span from lowest to highest note. A song might have a wide range but sit comfortably in your tessitura, or it might have a narrow range but sit in an uncomfortable part of your voice. Both factors matter when selecting repertoire.
	      </p>

	      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Tips for Accurate Range Testing</h2>
	      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
	        <li><strong>Test multiple times:</strong> Your first test might not be your most accurate. Test 2-3 times and take the average, or use your most consistent results.</li>
	        <li><strong>Use consistent vowels:</strong> Test with the same vowel sound (like "ah") for consistency. Different vowels can affect how high or low you can sing.</li>
	        <li><strong>Don't force extremes:</strong> If a note requires significant strain, it's not part of your usable range, even if you can produce a sound.</li>
	        <li><strong>Test both registers:</strong> If you can access head voice or falsetto, test those separately to get a complete picture.</li>
	        <li><strong>Consider your comfortable range:</strong> Your "comfortable range" (where you sound best) is often more useful than your absolute extremes.</li>
	        <li><strong>Document your results:</strong> Keep a record of your range tests over time to track your progress.</li>
	      </ul>

	      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Beyond Range: Other Important Vocal Measurements</h2>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        While vocal range is important, it's not the only measurement that matters:
	      </p>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Tessitura (Comfortable Range)</h3>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        Your tessitura is the part of your range where your voice feels most comfortable and sounds best. This is often more important than your absolute range for song selection.
	      </p>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Vocal Break (Passaggio)</h3>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        The passaggio is where your voice transitions between registers (e.g., chest voice to head voice). Identifying this helps you understand where you might need special technique.
	      </p>

	      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Vocal Weight and Timbre</h3>
	      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
	        Beyond range, your voice has a certain "weight" (light, medium, heavy) and timbre (bright, dark, warm) that affects which songs suit you best.
